            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am an experienced Software Developer with a robust background in designing, implementing, testing, and maintaining software systems. Currently, I am serving as a Software Engineering Manager at Dassault Syst√®mes Simulia Corp., where I develop and maintain high-performance structural simulation software for leading manufacturing and design firms. My work has significantly enhanced software reliability and stability, with a notable reduction in production issues by 70% through comprehensive automated testing.

                In my role, I have successfully developed public APIs, increasing coverage from 20% to 60%, and automated various software development processes, improving efficiency and reducing manual labor. My technical expertise spans multiple programming languages, including C++, Python, and Java, and I am adept at working in both Windows and Linux environments to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
                
                My prior experience includes a Software QA Internship at Ansys Inc., where I automated test cases and improved regression testing capabilities, and a Software Developer position at Dassault Systems in India, where I developed connectors for CATIA V5 for major clients such as Toyota and Honda.
                
                I hold an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Washington and a B.E. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Pune. My academic background, combined with hands-on experience in various programming languages and software development methodologies, positions me as a versatile and skilled professional ready to tackle new challenges and drive innovation in the software industry.
                
                I am a strong self-learner, always eager to take on more responsibilities and explore the latest tools and technologies to continue advancing my career and contributing to the success of my team and organization.</p>
